TODO
=====
This is a non-exculsive TODO list for wxWabbitemu.
This is a "take and work on it" kind of thing, so don't worry
about time constraints for implementing these features! ;)

This file is best viewed in a text editor with monospaced
font (also known as fixed width font - examples include
Courier New).

If you are appending to this list, follow this format:
= Feature/things
++++ Suggested by: username/name
++++ Rationale: why does this need to be implemented?
++++ Who's working on it: username/name working on it, as well
++++                      as suggestions on who could do it
++++ Implementor's notes: notes by the implementor

Separate them into a new line if they get too long, and indent
with spaces to the end of the colon+space.

That said, here are the things to be done:

= Image based keypad support
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody (Buckeye should, since this is probably
++++                      MUCH easier to implement from Wabbitemu. :P
++++                      (As he said, it requires some kind of resource
++++                      inclusion in which is available in wxWidgets,
++++                      but is somewhat tricky, and is kinda similar to
++++                      Windows' resource inclusion.)
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= GUI button based keypad support
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: alberthrocks (GUI code, and possibly button
++++                                    event binding as well - may
++++                                    need help with that)
++++ Implementor's notes: I'll be using wxGlade (exporting C++) to create
++++                      the GUI, since it's pretty fast and easy to use.
++++                      Event binding will probably either be done
++++                      inside wxGlade or outside (in the code).

= GIF recording
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Debugger
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Buckeye, but may need support of other people to
                          finish the port
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Sound
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Emulation Adjustment (pausing, speed modifying, resetting)
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Linking
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A
= ?? (add more stuff here!)
