TODO

Update this date whenever changes are made!

This is a non-exculsive TODO list for wxWabbitemu.
This is a "take and work on it" kind of thing, so don't worry
about time constraints for implementing these features! ;)

This file is best viewed in a text editor with monospaced
font (also known as fixed width font - examples include
Courier New).

If you are appending to this list, follow this format:
= Feature/things
++++ Suggested by: username/name
++++ Rationale: why does this need to be implemented?
++++ Who's working on it: username/name working on it, as well
++++                      as suggestions on who could do it
++++ Implementor's notes: notes by the implementor

Separate them into a new line if they get too long, and indent
with spaces to the end of the colon+space.

That said, here are the things to be done:

= Debugger
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Buckeye, but may need support of other people to
                          finish the port
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Sound
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Linking
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: meet the current featureset of Wabbitemu
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Wabbitemu shared library
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: Allow developers to include Wabbitemu in a library for
++++            their own use in their app. Code from here will probably
++++            be copied back to the original Wabbitemu project, since
++++            demand for such a library exists! ;)
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= Control emulated calculator with real calculator
++++ Suggested by: alberthrocks
++++ Rationale: Allow users to use their real calculator to control
++++            instead of using a mouse or keyboard. This will need
++++            a LOT of help from ASM devs, TiLP devs. and others.
++++            It may be possible to simply use a bit of remote8x code.
++++ Who's working on it: Nobody
++++ Implementor's notes: N/A

= ?? (add more stuff here!)
